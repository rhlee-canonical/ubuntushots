debshots - a web application to manage screenshots of GUI applications in Debian
================================================================================


About
=====

*debshots* is a simple web application to host screenshots
for the screenshots.debian.net web service. It accepts images
showing different views of GUI applications that are available
in Debian as software package. So users can get a visual impression
of what an application does. Following the karma of
*a picture is worth a thousand words*.

*debshots* is written in Python_ and uses the Pylons_ web framework.

Deployment/Installation
=============================

There are different ways to deploy *debshots* on a server. However the
following way worked so you may want to follow it. It is generally suggested
that *debshots* gets deployed using the *virtualenv* software which allow the
installation of Python modules (of any version) into a seperate Python
environment independent from what Python packages are installed elsewhere on
the system.

#. Install prerequisites (some modules compile C modules to work)

   > aptitude install python-dev gcc python-virtualenv python-pylons

#. Get your copy of debshots and create a source dist tarball

   > hg clone http://hg.workaround.org/debshots
   > python setup.py sdist
 
   Then copy dist/debshots-x.y.tar.gz onto the server where you want to
   deploy it.

#. Create a virtualenv

   > virtualenv .

   (Some people suggest you run virtualenv with "--no-site-packages" thus
   hiding the Python modules installed through Debian packages. But we
   need the python-apt and python-debian Debian packages visible to I don't
   use this option. I managed to install python-debian well but python-apt
   refused to install through the default Python "python setup.py install"
   way.)

#. Activate the virtualenv environment (sets some variables like
   $PYTHONPATH so installation of Python packages through
   setuptools/ez_install is done in this directory instead of
   system-wide)

   > source bin/activate

   Your shell prompt should have changed by now and start with
   "(debshots)".

#. Install the needed software for paste:

   > (debshots) easy_install paste
   > (debshots) easy_install pastescript

#. Install the debshots package:

   > (debshots) easy_install debshots-x.y.tar.gz

#. Create a new INI file that contains the global configuration:

   > (debshots) paster make-config debshots my.ini

#. Edit the 'my.ini' configuration file to control various
   aspects of debshots. Make sure that you set
   "set debug = false" before you deploy the application.

#. Set up the application (e.g. create required directories and database):

   > (debshots) paster setup-app my.ini

#. Now run the application through a web server:

   > (debshots) paster serve my.ini

#. Before you first run the server you need to get a list of available
   Debian packages. This is done by calling the importer script:

   > (debshots) bin/update_package_cache.py `pwd`/development.ini

   The table should be updated frequently (for example once per day)
   via a cron job.

#. To have someone keep an eye on the paster process I recommend you install
   the *daemontools* package. It would restart the process if it died
   and would help run the process in the background so you can safely
   log out without killing the process.

   > aptitude install daemontools
   > mkdir /etc/service/debshots

   Create a file /etc/service/debshots/run that starts the paster process.
   Example::

    #!/bin/sh
    export PYTHON_EGG_CACHE=/home/debshots/.python-eggs
    exec setuidgid debshots /home/debshots/bin/paster serve /home/debshots/my.ini

   Make this file executable.

   > chmod +x /etc/service/debshots

   Try /etc/service/debshots/run to see if the process would be starting.
   If all works well then start it through daemontools:

   > svc -u /etc/service/debshots


How does it work?
=================

Anybody can upload new screenshots. For security reasons though (we don't want
porn on the server) screenshots have to be approved by an administrator. The
permission system goes like this:

Visitor (anybody who visits the site):

- can upload screenshots (the new screenshots have status "unapproved"
  and can not be viewed publicly)
- can mark any approved (publicly visible) screenshots as "markedfordelete"
  which means screenshots are still visible but admins will see the tag
  and check if packages can be removed. ('markedfordelete' is a tribute
  to the incredibly trashy movie "The Tower" where the computer system
  "removed" a dove sitting on an air vent after deciding to have it
  "marked for delete").
- can remove their own uploaded screenshots (Screenshots in the database
  also save the session cookie value. So as long as the browser keeps the
  cookie the screenshots can be associated with the uploader.)

Admins (logged in users - accounts are saved in the 'admins' table):

- can upload screenshots that are automatically approved and visible
- can delete any screenshots
- can approve other people's screenshots that are still unapproved
- can see the moderation view of packages that have screenshots that
  are not approved or markedfordelete

Managing administrators
=======================

New admins can be created using the 'create_admin_user.py' script located
in the 'bin' directory:

  > bin/create_admin_user.py `pwd`/development.ini newusername newpassword

Admin users can be deleted using the 'delete_admin_user.py':

  > bin/delete_admin_user.py `pwd`/development.ini newusername newpassword

Hint: just adding rows to the 'admins' database table will not work.
You must set the password using the setpassword() method or otherwise the
salted MD5 hash used for passwords wouldn't get computed correctly.

Database structure
==================

There are two tables of packages. The 'cachedbinarypackages' table contains
a list of all packages parsed from what's in the archives. The 'packages'
table instead contains a list of all packages that have screenshots
assigned. Each 'package' has a number of 'screenshots' assigned which is
what a user would upload. And in turn each 'screenshot' consists of different
'images' like a big image and a thumbnail. And finally the 'admins' table
has a list of admin users and their (salted MD5-hashed) passwords stored.
