debshots - a web application to manage screenshots of GUI applications in Debian
================================================================================


About
=====

*debshots* is a simple web application to host screenshots
for the screenshots.debian.net web service. It accepts images
showing different views of GUI applications that are available
in Debian as software package. So users can get a visual impression
of what an application does. Following the karma of
*a picture is worth a thousand words*.

*debshots* is written in Python_ and uses the Pylons_ web framework.

Installation using virtualenv
=============================

It is generally suggested that *debshots* gets deployed using
the *virtualenv* software which creates a seperate Python
environment independent from what Python packages are installed
elsewhere on the system.

#. Install prerequisites.

   > aptitude install python-dev gcc python-virtualenv python-pylons

#. Get your copy of debshots

   > hg clone http://hg.workaround.org/debshots
   > cd debshots

#. Create a virtualenv

   > virtualenv .

#. Activate the virtualenv environment (set some variables like
   $PYTHONPATH so installation of Python packages through
   setuptools/ez_install is done in this directory instead of
   system-wide)

   > source bin/activate

   Your shell prompt should have changed by now and start with
   "(debshots").

#. Install the versions of Python packages that debshots depends on:

   > (debshots) python setup.py develop

   This will get the required packages from the internet and install
   them inside the virtualenv.

#. Edit the 'development.ini' configuration file to control various
   aspects of debshots. Make sure that you set
   "set debug = false" before you deploy the application.

#. Set up the application (e.g. create required directories):

   > (debshots) paster setup-app development.ini

#. Now run the application through a web server:

   > (debshots) paster serve development.ini

How does it work?
=================

Anybody can upload new screenshots. For security reasons (we don't want
porn on the server) screenshots have to be approved by an administrator

Adding administrators
=====================

There is not yet an automatic way to add administrators. You will have
to enter the Pylons shell by running "paster shell" in the project
(TODO: I think this won't work when deploying the application from an egg)
and create a new user:

  newadmin = model.Admin(name="dilbert")
  newadmin.setpassword('secret')
  db.save(newadmin)
  db.commit()
